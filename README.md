ELEC 5410 - Final Project
Classification and Connectivity Analysis in fMRI Data Using SVM
By Abdullah Alshehri
Submission Date: Dec/4/2023

OVERVIEW:
This project aims to classify fMRI data into distinct brain states using Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers. By leveraging connectivity features extracted from fMRI signals, the study explores the potential of machine learning in neuro-scientific analysis.

FILES INCLUDED:
- main.m: Main MATLAB script for executing the project.
- main_classification.m: MATLAB script for classification process.
- multi_svm_cv_ttest.m: MATLAB script for SVM classification with cross-validation and t-tests.
- ADHD_CC200_ROI_labels.xlsx: Excel file containing ROI labels for ADHD data.
- ELEC 5410 - Final Project - Paper.pdf: Detailed project report.
- data.mat: fMRI data file.

HOW TO RUN:
1. Ensure MATLAB is installed on your system.
2. Place all the MATLAB script files, the Excel file, and the 'data.mat' file in the same directory.
3. Open MATLAB and navigate to the directory containing the project files.
4. Run the 'main.m' script in MATLAB to execute the project.

DEPENDENCIES:
- MATLAB (with Statistical and Machine Learning Toolbox)
- Brain Connectivity Toolbox (for graph-theoretical feature extraction, if used)
